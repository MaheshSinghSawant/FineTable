              <p>As wonderful as FineTable may appear, do not be fooled for it was created by Team Six which consist of six web development novices.
              What we lack in PHP skill we make up for with tenacity. At the start FineTable was the love child none of use wanted to claim, but over time with enough TLC,
              FineTable has blossomed into, what we believe, is an awesome Web Application.</p>
