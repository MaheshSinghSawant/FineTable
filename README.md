# FineTable

For my Software Engineering class CSC 848 we created a website very similar to OpenTable. It functions in a manner similar to it with regular users having the abilty to reserve tables at the restaurant of their choice. Registered users have the ability to rate the restaurants and give reviews.
The owner of the restaurant can list their restaurant and make changes to its description, menu and pctures.
The host at the restaurant can confirm check-ins according to the website.
